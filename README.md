## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `:ex_aws_bedrock` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`
along with `:ex_aws`, `:jason` JSON codec, and your preferred HTTP client

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_aws, ">= 2.5.1"},
    {:ex_aws_bedrock, "~> 1.5"},
    {:hackney, "~> 1.9"},
    {:jason, "~> 1.1"},
    {:poison, "~> 3.0"}
  ]
end
```

While `ex_aws` allows you to choose JSON codec the input to the AWS models are JSON and this library
chooses to accept maps and structs that implement the [Jason Encoder protocol](jason).

## Unit tests

The default suite of unit tests verify the requests generated by this library. 
If you wish to test against AWS with live requests then you need to 
configure `ExAws` in the standard way as described in it's README.

For example you could create an `.env` file:

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AK..."
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
    export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
    
Then set the variables and run the tests with:

    source .env && mix test --only aws
